# Solution to the Mini CTF.

## The steps to resolve the CTF are:
1. Make sure to have the circom and snarkjs installed as mentioned in the links to the circom documentation.
2. Download the files or clone the repo and move into the **prover** directory.
3. Open a terminal and start chisel : `chisel`
4. Get the input value needed in the input.json file : ```uint256 inputVal = uint256(keccak256("https://yacademy.dev/"));```<br>[Input value](generate_input.png)<br>
5. Enter the resulting int value into the input.json <br>[Edit file](change_input.png)<br>
6. Run the node command to generate a witness ```node generate_witness.js circuit.wasm input.json witness.wtns```
7. This will create a file called `witness.wtns`
8. Run the snarkjs command to create the proof.json and public.json files: ```snarkjs groth16 prove circuit_0001.zkey witness.wtns proof.json public.json```
9. Run the snarkjs command to generate the call data to send in the call from REMIX: ```snarkjs generatecall``` <br>[Generate call](generate_call.png)<br>
10. Open REMIX and interact with the CTFVerifier contract at address 0x37dEA441346447b271c372Bd21dEc2347aB6d0f4
11. Enter the value that was generated by the snarkjs command and it should return true <br>[It Worked](itworked.png)<br>
